Keystroke dynamics the behavioral biometric authentication method which uses the
key presses typed into a keyboard. Every user has a unique typing pattern, which
consists of,
1. The time a key is held pressed (maybe different for each keys, depending on
   the hand and the finger which is used to type the letter)
2. The flight time between two keys (different for each digraph ie. letter pair)
3. Which shift key is pressed with which keys (not used in this program)
4. The angle, pressure on keys - requires special equipment/ not used here. 

Advantage of this biometric is that is does not need any special device. 
But this method will be inaccurate because, the user's typing speed depends on
his/her mood, and physical status.
